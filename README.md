### 🛍️ Urban.Grocers web app API testing
**Urban.Grocers** is a web application for purchasing products online through themed kits, simplifying the acquisition of items for specific events like parties, gatherings, or standard shopping lists. <br>
As the **QA Engineer** on this project, I was tasked with validating updates to the kit processing logic within the application's API. The API specifications were documented using Apidoc.
I developed a comprehensive **Postman** collection to structure and execute test scenarios. This allowed me to systematically validate various test cases derived from the requirements. All defects identified during testing were logged, tracked, and managed through **Jira**, ensuring clear communication with the development team and contributing to endpoint stability and final product quality.
<br>

**Key Results & Impact** :
+ Created and executed a detailed test plan comprising **40 test cases**, ensuring full coverage of the update's requirements.
+ Built a reusable Postman collection with **6 core functions**, streamlining the API testing process.
+ Identified, documented, and reported **17 defects in Jira**, including **4 critical-severity bugs**, preventing major issues from reaching production.
 
**Tech & Tools**: Postman, API testing, Functional Testing, Test Case Design, Defect & Tracking Management (Jira).
