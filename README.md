## 📂 My Projects
### 🛍️ Urban.Grocers web app API testing
**Urban.Grocers** is a web application for purchasing products online through themed kits, simplifying the acquisition of items for specific events like parties, gatherings, or standard shopping lists. <br>
As the **QA Engineer** on this project, I was tasked with validating updates to the kit processing logic within the application's API. The API specifications were documented using Apidoc.
I developed a comprehensive **Postman** collection to structure and execute test scenarios. This allowed me to systematically validate various test cases derived from the requirements. All defects identified during testing were logged, tracked, and managed through **Jira**, ensuring clear communication with the development team and contributing to endpoint stability and final product quality.
<br>

**Key Results & Impact**:
+ Created and executed a detailed test plan comprising **40 test cases**, ensuring full coverage of the update's requirements.
+ Built a reusable Postman collection with **6 core functions**, streamlining the API testing process.
+ Identified, documented, and reported **17 defects in Jira**, including **4 critical-severity bugs**, preventing major issues from reaching production.
 
**Tech & Tools**: Postman, API testing, Functional Testing, Test Case Design, Jira.

### Urban.Routes web app testing
**Urban.Routes** is a web application for requesting urban transportation services and optimizing routes. The platform offers a diverse catalog of options, including taxis, carpooling, bicycles, and scooters. <br>
As a member of the Quality Assurance (QA) team, I was responsible for the comprehensive validation of the design and functionality of the new *"Carpool"* feature. **Functional requirements** and **user interface (UI)** designs were provided to me in PDF documents and **Figma** mockups, respectively.
I developed a structured test plan that included detailed verification points and formal test cases. Execution involved **manual testing**, performing **cross-browser compatibility testing** on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, and **responsive design validation** across multiple screen resolutions. I used **browser DevTools** to inspect application behavior, monitor network requests, and verify correct backend communication. Every identified defect was documented, prioritized, and formally reported in Jira for tracking. <br>

**Key Results & Impact**:

+ Developed a comprehensive test plan with **85 verification points** and **14 formal test cases**, covering both design **(UI/UX)** and functionality. This process included clarifying ambiguous requirements.
+ Executed compatibility and usability tests across two different browser environments and multiple responsive views, using **DevTools** for in-depth diagnostics.
+ Detected, analyzed, and reported 30 defects in **Jira**, with two classified as critical severity, preventing major impacts on the user experience.
